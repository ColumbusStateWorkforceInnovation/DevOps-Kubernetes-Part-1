# Infrastructure Automation Kubernetes Lab 4 

## Introduction: 

This lab is to help gain familiarity with some basic kubernetes resources.  More examples with k8s commands can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/ColumbusStateWorkforceInnovation/infrastructure-kubernetes-week-1-examples) 

---
## Objective

In this Lab we will go over the core features that make up Kubernetes. Make sure you have read the slides before going through this so you have a general understanding. 

Understanding the core components, how they are used, and what they are used for are necessary before starting to use the higher-level kubernetes objects and resources.

---
## Getting Started:

1 - Copy the starter code from here into a new, private repository in your personal GitHub account. When adding a collaborator, be sure to add the instructor ("CSCC-Instructor").


2 - You need minikube up and running before going through the examples.

Start minikube using the command:
```
$ minikube start
```

If you do not have this setup please go to the [pre-lab] and follow those instructions before continuing.

Please make sure your minikube is cleaned, by deleting all contexts, resources, configs, pods, and namespaces made.

You can do it using the `kubectl delete <resource> <name>` command or go with the scorched earth method and run ...

```
$ minikube stop
$ minikube delete
$ minikube start
```

## Understanding the Starter Code
This repository contains 4 exercises/tasks. They are to be done in order.
1. namespace_and_context
2. pods 
3. labels_and_selectors
4. exposing_applications

Within each directory, there is a readme with the excerise. Follow the directions, and update (if required) the provided manifest in each task directory under manifests. There is also maybe a file in each directory where you may be asked to record some information while doing the excerise.

## Completing the Assignment


### 1 - Go through examples

Go through each of the directories provided, and complete the tasks. You will be updating the manifests and recording any questions asked in provided files within each directory.

The general manifest structures have been provided for ease of use, you are required to update it according to the task.
